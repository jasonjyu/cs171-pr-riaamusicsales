Notes from Final Project Design Studio on 4/14/2015

After sharing our project design on the sale of music formats over time with another group, we received feedback 
and a couple suggestions on how we couple improve our design. The other group found our topic to be interesting,
and certainly worthy of being visualized, but thought we should add a couple things:

1) Most critically, we had a number of interesting charts and graphs, but needed to take these visualizations and
tell a concise story with the data. 

To combat this concern, our group is looking into developing a timeline, which would be next to our visualization. 
Viewers could click through certain chosen "important dates of the music industry", which would create a text box which 
would then explain causes of spikes and dips in the data, or the competition of rival media types at a certain time.

2)Other feedback included whether it could be possible to include the most popular songs for each year, or possibly
the most highly sold song/album on each format type.

As of right now we don't really believe that the most popular song per year is directly applicable to our data, but are
interested in including the most popular song/album, or even genre, for each media type. However, while we are currently 
looking for this type of data within databases such as "MusicBrainz" (suggested by our feedback group), we have currently 
not been able to get accurate data of this type.

3)The last major piece of feedback we received was whether we could include illegal download information as another line 
on our graphs. This was intriguing, and we are currently looking for accurate data for the total illegal music downloads per year, 
(it was not included in our original database). We are still not certain whether this will fit into our data well, as by nature
illegal downloads are not paid for, but it would certainly be interesting to at least compare total units.

We found the feedback we received to be thoughtful and quite helpful. The addition of a stronger narrative to our visualization
should hopefully help make it feel more impactful and interesting to the user.
